Hello! I'm Nilufar — a data enthusiast, an international student, and an avid explorer. My journey started in Italy, and I am now continuing my adventures in France, embracing every new challenge and culture along the way.

My journey into the world of data began with a leap of faith. I have a Bachelor's in International Business and Management, but I discovered a true passion for solving problems with code and data. I realized that behind every business decision, there's a story waiting to be told through data, and I wanted to be the one telling it. That's why I made the exciting pivot to pursue Data Analytics and Engineering. For me, coding is like a superpower—it’s the tool that lets me build, explore, and make sense of the world in a meaningful way.

My love for exploration isn’t limited to datasets. From childhood, I dreamed of traveling and experiencing new cultures. That dream was my motivation: to work hard, save up, and be brave enough to move to Europe with just one suitcase (that held my entire life!). It was a romantic and thrilling start to a new chapter. So far, I’ve been fortunate to visit over 6 countries and more than 35 cities across Europe. Each place has taught me something new, and each journey has reminded me how much there is left to discover.

When I’m not analyzing data or planning my next trip, you’ll find me staying active—whether it’s going for a run along the cobblestone streets or starting to explore the world of hiking, one trail at a time. I believe a curious mind and an active body are the best companions for a fulfilling life.

I am currently looking for my next professional adventure—a role where I can apply my skills in data analytics and engineering, keep learning, and wake up every morning excited to contribute. If you’re looking for a motivated, curious, and dedicated teammate, let’s connect!
