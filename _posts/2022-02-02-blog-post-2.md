This interview features Margarita Pavlova, a 2019 graduate of the "Economics" program at HSE University - St. Petersburg. She shared her inspiring journey into academia and her experience of moving to the Czech Republic to pursue a PhD.

### Key Insights from the Conversation

**On Deciding to Move to the Czech Republic:**
Margarita's move was facilitated by her professor, Sergey Slobodyan, who was then teaching at HSE and is now the director of CERGE-EI in Prague. He offered to write recommendation letters for interested students. Margarita mentioned that the strong reputation of HSE University ("a mark of quality") significantly smoothed her application process, and she was admitted without major issues.

**On Women in Academia:**
"By my own example, I try to prove that there is a place for women in science," Margarita stated. She recalled attending a summer school in Jerusalem where the lecturer notably welcomed a large number of female participantsâ€”a stark contrast to previous years where there were only three. She acknowledged that while women often gravitate towards applied rather than theoretical research, their place in science is undeniable, even if it must be actively claimed.

**Advice for Young Women in Science:**
Her key advice is self-confidence: "You must realize that you are valuable in yourself, and it doesn't matter what environment you are in." She feels that in Europe, there is practically no pressure based on gender and that you simply get used to working in male-dominated teams.

**On Overcoming the Fear of Moving Abroad:**
Margarita was candid about the difficulty, recalling crying at Russian passport control out of fear. Her crucial advice for anyone moving abroad is: **"The main thing is not to be alone."**
She emphasized how lucky she was to have a classmate from her bachelor's program in the same PhD cohort, which provided immense moral support. She points out that moving for study simplifies building a new social circle through the university. While her next potential move to Barcelona feels less daunting, the new language barrier (Spanish/Catalan) presents a fresh challenge compared to the familiar Slavic roots of Czech.
