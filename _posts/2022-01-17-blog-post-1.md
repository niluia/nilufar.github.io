I had the pleasure of co-interviewing Anastasia Isakova, a talented 2021 graduate of the "International Business and Management" program at HSE University - St. Petersburg. Anastasia's story is inspiringâ€”she successfully balances her master's studies with two demanding jobs, runs her own business, and leads major projects at the Skolkovo Innovation Center.

Here are the key highlights from our conversation:

### Key Career Insights

**1. Thriving in a Remote, Trust-Based Culture.**
Anastasia works at the venture fund and consulting firm **Startup Lab**. She started her internship there in her fourth year and loved their approach to work. She emphasized the importance of a trust-based culture over micromanagement:
> *"It doesn't matter how many hours you clock in; what matters is that you take responsibility for a task and deliver on your promise. This remote flexibility allows me to balance my studies, work, photography, and friendsâ€”it's the model that works for me."*

She is now developing a new management direction within the company based on this same principle of trust in clients and employees.

**2. Leading Innovation at Skolkovo.**
Her second role involves **managing projects for Skolkovo**, specifically the "Navigator Innovator" platform. This initiative helps students and graduates develop their project ideasâ€”from physics to chemistryâ€”and prepare them for presentation to investors. She guides participants through the process with the help of trackers and experts.

**3. Maintaining a Balanced Life.**
Despite her busy schedule, Anastasia makes time for her passions, including weekly vocal lessons and a new fitness class called 'Barre'.
