A highlight of my student leadership experience was co-organizing the annual SHEM Ball, a prestigious formal event held in a historic palace in Saint Petersburg. Our team successfully brought together over **1000 participants**, including students, faculty, and distinguished professors, for an evening of celebration.

### My Role & Responsibilities

As a core member of the organizing committee, my responsibilities encompassed:
*   **Venue Coordination:** Securing and managing logistics for the historic palace venue.
*   **Participant Engagement:** Leading efforts to promote the event and manage registrations for the large number of attendees.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Working closely with a dedicated team to coordinate all aspects of the event, from program planning to guest experience.

### Event Highlights

The evening featured formal dinners, traditional dances, and networking opportunities, creating a memorable experience that bridged the gap between students and the academic community.
